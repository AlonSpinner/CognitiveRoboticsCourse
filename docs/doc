-------------------------------------progress:
(1) I need to define the problem.pddl and domain.pddl files, hopefully from python
	for that I need to use a python parser -> pddl or understand how to do it myself

(2) I need a solver that works on those files
	
We'll start with only fluents (numbers with "+", "-", "*" and "/" operations)
After which we will try to add durative actions

Both solver and parser need to have the capabilties for fluents and durative actions

-------------------------------------good stuff:
https://planning.wiki
	shows different PDDL versions and their usages

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch0AnXVuNN8&ab_channel=MauroVallati 
	talk about classical planning explaining what grounding is 

A good solver using julia?
	from examples, seems to be working with only the basics. no fluents or durations

python pddl parser with durative actions and others?

	Maybe this is all I need? "The unified_planning library makes it easy to formulate planning problems and to invoke automated planners."
